# HCBot
This bot was created using discordgo to serve in the Halo Completionist Discord by assigning Halo games completion roles to requesting members.

After requesting a role check through "/rolecheck", the bot will check Xbox Live through the free OpenXBL REST API for the user's achievements and according to their progress, either assign a completion role or show what games they need to complete to obtain the role.
