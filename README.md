# HCBot
This bot was created using discordgo to serve in the Halo Completionist Discord by assigning Halo games completion roles to requesting members.

After requesting a role check with `/rolecheck`, the bot will check Xbox Live through the free OpenXBL REST API for the user's achievements and assign a completion role depending on their progress or completion.
